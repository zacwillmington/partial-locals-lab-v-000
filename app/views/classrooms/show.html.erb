Classroom Info
<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>
<% binding.pry %>

<% @classroom.student do |classroom| %>
    <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: classroom.student}%>
<% end %>

<!-- <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @student}%> -->
