Classroom Info
<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>
<!-- <% binding.pry %> -->

<% @classroom.students.each do |student| %>
    <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: student} %>
<% end %>

We now want to call out the oldest student in the class:
<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @classroom.oldest_student} %>
