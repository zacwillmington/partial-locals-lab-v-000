Classroom Info
<%= render partial: 'classroom', locals: {classroom: @classroom} %>
<!-- <% binding.pry %> -->

<% @classroom.students do |student| %>
    <%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {student: @student} %>
    <% binding.pry %>
<% end %>

<%= render partial: 'students/student', locals: {oldest_student: @student.oldest_student} %>
